Cell: The fundamental unit of life
Plasma Membrane: The outer boundary of a cell, composed of a lipid bilayer regulates passage
Nucleus: The central organelle that houses the cell's genetic material 
Cytoplasm: The gel-like substance within a cell that contains organelles 
Organelle: Specialized structures within a cell that perform specific functions
Endoplasmic Reticulum : A network of membranes involved in protein and lipid synthesis 
Ribosome: Cellular structures responsible for protein synthesis 
Golgi Apparatus: modifies, sorts, and packages proteins and lipids for transport within the cell
Mitochondria: Organelles that produce energy (ATP) through cellular respiration
Lysosome: Membrane-bound organelles containing digestive enzymes to break down waste materials 
Cytoskeleton: A network of protein filaments that provides structural support 
Cilia and Flagella: Hair-like projections on the cell surface that are involved in movement 
Endocytosis: The process by which cells engulf external particles or fluids by enclosing them
Exocytosis: The process by which cells release materials stored in vesicles 
Nucleolus: A substructure within the nucleus responsible for ribosome production
Chromatin: A complex of DNA and proteins that make up the genetic material 
Microtubules: Protein filaments that make up part of the cytoskeleton 
Cell Cycle: The series of events that lead to cell growth and the production of two cells
Meiosis: Division process that reduces the chromosome number by half to create gametes 
Mitosis: The process of cell division that results in two identical daughter cells for growth 
Cell Adhesion: The ability of cells to stick together through various molecular interactions
Phagocytosis: A type of endocytosis in which a cell engulfs large particles
Nuclear Envelope: Double membrane surrounding the nucleus that separates it from the cytoplasm
Receptor Proteins: Cell surface proteins that bind to specific ligands to initiate responses
Cellular Respiration: The process in which cells convert glucose and oxygen into energy
