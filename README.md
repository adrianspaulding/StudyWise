# General Thoughts and Recommendations for Programming Style

-Please use 4 spaces for indentation levels. Most coding environments have an option to where 
 you can change the tab setting to insert 4 spaces. Replit defaults to 2 spaces, so if you use
 that, please be sure to change that setting.

-Variable names should be camelCase. In case you don't know, that means the first word is
 lower case and the start of each new word is capitalized. Some examples include numArray,
 userInput, thisIsSomeVariable, and intAsString.

-Please be sure to include occasional comments about what you're doing. It doesn't have to be
 every line, but it will let everyone know, including yourself, what your intentions were when
 writing a part of code. This will greatly assist in the debugging process.

-Please use ~80 characters as the maximum line length. Python, unlike C++ and other programming
 languages, will not just let you hit enter between operations to continue a line. You must use
 a backslash (\\\) then enter. If you aren't sure about what this means, please ask Adrian.
