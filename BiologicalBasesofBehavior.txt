Neroscience: any or all of the sciences which deal with the structure of the nervous system 
Neuron: a nerve cell; the basic building block of the nervous system.
Dendrite: the bushy, branching extensions of a neuron that receive messages and conduct impulses 
Axon: the extension of a neuron, ending in branching terminal fibers
Efferent Neurons: neurons that carry outgoing information from the ventral nervous system 
Interneurons: central nervous system neurons that internally communicate between sensory inputs 
Synapse: the junction between the axon tip of the sending neuron and the dendrite 
Action Potential: a neural impulse; a brief electrical charge that travels down an axon. 
Refractory Period: a resting period after orgasm
All-Or-Nothing Principle: A neuron will either fire or not; no in between.
Glial Cells: Cells in the nervous system that support, nourish, and protect neurons.
Myelin Shealth: a layer of fatty tissue segmentally encasing the fibers of many neurons
Neurotransmitters: chemical messengers that traverse the synaptic gaps between neurons
Agonists: mimics a neurotransmitter, like a medication
Antagonists: blocks neurotransmitter
Acetylcholine: a neurotransmitter that enables learning and also triggers muscle contraction
Norepinephrine: functions- physcial arousal, mood, learning
Dopamine: function-pleasure/reward, movement
Seratonin: function- emotional state/mood, sleep
GABA: function- best known inhibitory transmitter, sleep
Glutamate: function-major excitatory neurotransmitter, learning & memory
Endorphins: function- pain control, pleasure
Peripheral Nervous System: motor neurons that connect the central nervous system to the body
Somatic Nervous System: division of the peripheral nervous system 
Autonomic Nervous System: the part of the peripheral nervous system that controls the glands
